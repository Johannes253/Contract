# Team Contract
- A Team Contract is a document prepared by each team prior to starting work on group projects.
Students should be held accountable and responsible for their own actions. Students will develop their
own "rules of engagement" through development of a Team Contract. This contract provides an
opportunity for your group to specify preferred methods of communication, action plans, meeting
schedules, goals, and consequences of actions (or inactions) of group members. The contract should be
developed and signed BEFORE starting the actual course project. For the Team Contract to be valid,
provide the signed and dated original contract to me by the specified deadline on your course
schedule. Give a photocopy of the original to each group member for their records. This
document is more for your group than it is for me so feel free to tailor it to your group's needs.

E. Consequences of breach of contract:
What procedures and penalties do you wish to implement in the case of "slackers" or team members who
deviate from your Team Contract? You basically have two options here:

1.) No Peer Evaluation or

2.)Peer Evaluation. Either option is acceptable to me, but I strongly advise you implement Peer
Evaluation so that you have a mechanism in place if problems arise.
1. No Peer Evaluation: Your group may decide that you do not want any form of peer evaluation
and that you will trust each other to pull their weight throughout the entire semester. If that is your
decision, in this section of your contract, simply specify the following statement: All group
members will receive the same grade on every aspect of the project regardless of their
contribution and regardless of any problems that may arise throughout the semester.
2. Peer Evaluation: If you would like some form of peer evaluation, specify the following
statement: Our team will conduct peer evaluation as part of this project.
• You cannot change any aspect of the team contract, particularly the "Procedures" section, once
the signed contract has been turned in to me. Therefore, be VERY SPECIFIC on the Procedures
section and spend some time thinking about this section. The only way I will accept a change to
your Team Contract is if ALL members of your team sign and date a written amendment to your
initial agreement.


• If you do some form of anonymous peer evaluation, please collect them in sealed envelopes from
each team member. Turn in the entire packet of sealed envelopes no later than the day your
project is due or, if applicable, the date specified on the course Schedule.


• If your project has a mid-semester benchmark or group presentation, in addition to a final project,
consider whether or not you want peer evaluation for these aspects as well as the final project. If
your team is doing peer evaluations throughout the semester, in addition to the date your project
is due, include such due dates on your contract.


• I will provide notification via e-mail to any student whose grade may be lowered as a result of the
peer evaluation.


1. Policies for handling infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract:

Given passes for reasonable excuses for both school and personal life. There will still need to be some communication with the team for the incedents.


2. Policies for handling persistent infractions:

Meeting with the person with infractions, the team, and Dr. Goadrich. Discuss some of the issues and try to come up with a solution.
